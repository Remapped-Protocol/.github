# Remapped Protocol (RMP)

Remapped Protocol (RMP) is infrastructure for resilient message verification and identity attestation,
designed to operate in degraded, offline, or adversarial network environments.

RMP prioritizes predictability, transparency, and constrained authority over growth or speculation.

## What RMP is
- Messaging verification infrastructure
- Identity attestation framework
- Offline- and delay-tolerant by design
- Non-token-governed

## What RMP is not
- Not a DAO
- Not a yield or mining network
- Not a pay-to-use messaging platform
- Not token-governed

## Token
The RMP token is a native asset with a fixed supply.
It exists solely to fund development, infrastructure, and security.

The token:
- Grants no governance rights
- Is not required to use messaging or identity features

## Code availability
Core runtime and infrastructure code will be published after internal hardening and review.
This organization intentionally exposes no executable protocol code at this stage.
